## Run k-means using 3 clusters on the 1953 and 2008 datasets separately. What do you see? 

In 1953, most countries are clustered towards the bottom right corner of the plot whereas in 2008 more coutnries are clustered towards the upper left corner of the plot.

This means that for many countries the life expectancy has increased and the birth rate has decreased - possibly due to better health care and the reduced need for reproduction/birth rate control policies. 

## Next, run the algorithm with 4 clusters on dataBoth.csv. Note any observations in your text file. Which countries are moving up clusters? How does “(2008) South Africa” compare to “(1953) United States”? Are there any 2008 countries that are in a cluster that is made up mostly of 1953 countries? Try and explain why. Are there any 1953 countries that are in a cluster that is made up of mostly 2008 countries? Try and explain why in your text file.

* (2008) South Africa is in the same cluster as (1953) USA
* Cluster 0 (bottom right) mostly consists of 1953 countries but (2008) Afghanistan is in this cluster - likely due to the impact of various wars in recent history
* Cluster 3 (top left) mostly consists of 2008 countries but highly developed countries in 1953 such as Belgium, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Sweden.. are in this cluster - likely due to its high quality of living/healthcare and the lowered need for reproduction
