# ================== Types of Errors ==================
# There are 3 types of errors:
#   - Compilation or syntax errors
#   - Runtime errors
#   - Logical errors


# ************ Example 1 ************ 
#Print("Hello World!")
# The statement above is an example of a syntax error.
# As you can see the print keyword has a capital 'P', but  Python is case sensitive so Print and print are two different things.
# Try removing the # from in front of the print statement and run this program; do you see the error?

# ************ Example 2 ************
#word = "Python"
#character = word[6]
# The statement above is an example of a runtime error.
# As you can see, the second statement is referencing an index that is out of bounds.
# Try removing the # from in front of both statements above and run this program; do you see the error?

# ************ Example 3 ************
#areaTrapezoid = 3 + 5 * 6 / 2
#print(areaTrapezoid)
# The statement above is an example of a logical error.
# The code above should calculate the area of a Trapezoid with parallel sides of length 3 and 5, and a height of 6.
# The area of this trapezoid should be 24, but when you run this program, you see that this is not the case.
# This is because of the missing brackets around 3 + 5
# The statement should be:
#       areaTrapezoid = (3 + 5) * 6 / 2
